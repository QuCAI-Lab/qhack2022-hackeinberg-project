# COMMENTS
# To use IPython with notebooks or the Qt console we also install Jupyter: $ python -m pip install jupyter.
# The 'pip install jupyter' command will install the Jupyter system, including the jupyter notebook, qtconsole, and the IPython kernel.
# The -m flag in "python -m pip" enforce the pip version tied to the active environment (executes pip as the __main__ module).
